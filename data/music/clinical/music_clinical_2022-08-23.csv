There is only minimal crypt architectural distortion with any mild focal goblet cell depletion. Only very occasional scattered crypt abscesses are seen throughout the colon.
Granulomata are not seen and there is no evidence of dysplasia in any of these biopsies.

Conclusion: The colonic biopsies show evidence of pancolonic mildly active inflammatory bowel disease. It is presumed that the histological features have been modified by steroid therapy. Nonetheless the overall appearance of the clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease. The ileal biopsies are normal which correlates with the endoscopic findings.

The biopsies from all sites in the large bowel are inflamed. There is expansion of the lamina propria by moderate chronic inflammation which appears diffuse in the right side of the colon but more patchy in the left side, particularly in the rectum.

There is patchy mild active inflammation throughout the large bowel, with foci of cryptitis, occasional crypt abscess and neutrophils in the surface of the ileum. There is no frank ulceration or surface erosion. No granulomas or viral inclusions are seen.

Crypt architecture is largely preserved with only occasional minor crypt abnormalities and occasional crypt loss. There is mild mucin depletion throughout. Paneth cell metaplasia is noted in the sigmoid colon and rectum. There is no dysplasia or malignancy.
      
Comment:
The appearances are in keeping with pan colonic, mildly active chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
The histological appearances are rather non-specific, however the patchy nature of the inflammation, particularly distally, would be in keeping with the clinical impression of medically treated Crohn's disease.

The biopsies from the ascending colon and transverse colon exhibit focal crypt loss, crypt shortening and crypt architectural distortion but no evidence of active inflammation.

The biopsies from the descending colon through to the rectum are all abnormal exhibiting a moderate relatively diffuse increase in chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria associated with quite marked crypt architectural distortion but only mild focal goblet cell depletion and minimal focal cryptitis. These changes are possibly more marked in the biopsies from the descending colon however the more distal biopsies are somewhat superficial so this may represent a sampling error. Paneth cell metaplasia is seen extending to the descending colon. Granulomata are not seen in these biopsies despite examining multiple levels and there is no evidence of dysplasia in any of these biopsies.
                                
Review of previous biopsies:                              
The biopsies from 2009 exhibit the features of a mildly active chronic inflammatory bowel disease involving the left colon and rectum there is moderate crypt architectural distortion with villiform change on the surface. The biopsies from the 2011 exhibit similar features again there is only focal activity in the form of crypt abscesses is a slightly more than the biopsies from 2009. The biopsies from 2012 are the first full colonoscopic series, the terminal ileal biopsies are normal, the colonic biopsies are all abnormal with crypt architectural distortion being the predominant abnormality comment the degree of inflammation and architectural distortion increases distally, ulceration seen within the sigmoid colon and rectum. The sigmoidoscopic biopsies from 2016 extend from this the transverse colon to the rectum and again show evidence of active chronic IBD with focal ulceration. The full colonoscopic series from 2016 also shows increasing crypt architectural distortion distally, the disease is less active in these biopsies and while a small granulomata is seen in one of the biopsies from the ascending colon this appears to be related to an inflamed crypt. Isolated granulomata are not seen in any of these biopsies.
                                
Final conclusion:
All of the biopsies from 2009 to the current biopsies exhibit the features of mildly active chronic inflammatory bowel disease and the pattern is unequivocally that of ulcerative colitis. While in many of the biopsies including the current ones the inflammation is limited to the left colon there are architectural changes seen in the right colon indicating that there has been previous inflammation and indeed right colonic inflammation was seen in the biopsies from 2012. I presume the relative lack of active inflammation the current biopsies is a consequence of  medical therapy.

2-7.  Examination shows large bowel mucosa.  There is mild architectural distortion with very occasional branching crypts in the more proximal biopsies and crypts more spaced apart and more random in the left sided/distal biopsies. There is a mild increase in mixed inflammatory cells within the lamina propria more proximally which overall becomes more prominent distally but prominent cryptitis and crypt abscess formation are not features.  There is a degree of fibrosis in the more distal biopsies.
                                
The features of this biopsy series are consistent with mildly active/partially treated ulcerative colitis but with relatively little by way of acute/active inflammation.  No granulomas/dysplasia or malignancy are seen.  No viral inclusions are identified on H&E.

In the terminal ileum, there is patchy active inflammation of the mucosa, with partial blunting of villi, mixed infiltrate of the lamina propria with a few epithelioid granulomas, and focal surface erosion with intra-epithelial neutrophils.  Other fragments from the terminal ileum have normal villous and
crypt architecture with no active inflammation.  CMV cytopathic changes are not  seen.
                                
In the caecum, there is mild active inflammation with patchy lamina propria infiltrate, and a few co-incident foci of cryptitis, and an occasional small granuloma.  Crypt architecture here is very mildly distorted.  Some fragments are not inflamed, with normal architecture.
                                
In the ascending colon there is a single focus of cryptitis with an associated granuloma.  Crypt architecture here is essentially normal.
                                
In the descending and sigmoid colon, there is mild focal crypt distortion, and metaplastic paneth cells.  There is very focal active inflammation in the sigmoid colon, with a single instance of mild cryptitis.
                                
In the rectum, there is patchy active inflammation with mixed lamina propria infiltrate, along with cryptitis and occasional crypt abscesses.  Crypt architecture here is distorted.  A single epithelioid granuloma is also seen.

Findings are in keeping with active chronic inflammatory bowel disease with the  patchy distribution within and between the sampled sites entirely in keeping with the established Crohn's disease diagnosis.  On histology, there is mild disease activity in the terminal ileum, caecum, and rectum, with relatively quiescent disease in ascending, descending and sigmoid colon.  There is no evidence of dysplasia.

The biopsies from the terminal ileum exhibit extensive ulceration. The intact mucosa is markedly inflamed and exhibits crypt architectural distortion with goblet cell depletion and almost complete villous atrophy.

The biopsies from the caecum also exhibits focal ulceration however the nonulcerated mucosa is only minimally abnormal with a mild focal increase in lamina propria inflammation. The biopsies from the ascending colon exhibit focal lamina propria inflammation associated with localised crypt elongation and little in the way of active crypt inflammation. Most the biopsy fragments from this site are however normal.

The biopsies from the transverse colon also exhibit focal ulceration, the adjacent mucosa shows an increase in chronic inflammatory cells lamina propria with occasional crypt abscesses and foci of cryptitis but only minimal crypt architectural distortion and focal goblet cell depletion. One biopsy fragment from this site is however normal.

Focal ulceration is also seen in the descending colon though the accompanying intact mucosal fragments are normal. The biopsies from the sigmoid colon and rectum are normal.

Neither granulomata nor CMV inclusions are seen. There is also no evidence of dysplasia.

Colonoscopic biopsies:
1.  Neoterminal ileum.
2.  Anastomosis.
3.  Transverse colon.
4.  Rectum.

Microscopy
The biopsies from the neoterminal ileum are of small bowel type mucosa which shows some mild disturbance of the mucosal architecture with quite broad villae and some oedema in the lamina propria.  There is no evidence of active inflammation, however, and granulomas are not seen.

The biopsies from the anastomosis consist of a mixture of probable small bowel type mucosa and colonic mucosa.  One fragment appears uninflamed whilst the other fragment shows rather patchy acute and chronic inflammation with neutrophils present within epithelium, cryptitis but no crypt abscesses.  No granulomas are seen.  No CMV inclusions are seen.

The colonic biopsies are all of normal colonic mucosa showing no evidence of inflammation or granulomas.  There is no evidence of dysplasia.

Comment
This colonoscopic series shows active inflammation at the anastomosis only with some minimal architectural change in the neoterminal ileum.  The inflammation at the anastomosis may not necessarily represent active Crohn's disease, but simply reflect inflammation secondary to the anastomosis.  There is no evidence of active disease elsewhere.

All of these biopsies are abnormal exhibiting focal crypt architectural distortion which is more marked in the rectum where it results in a villiform mucosal surface. There are scattered large crypt abscesses and occasional foci of cryptitis. Overall goblet cells are however well preserved. There is an accompanying mild somewhat variable increase in chronic inflammatory cells in lamina propria which is slightly more marked in the rectum.

Granulomata are not seen nor amoebae identified (though further levels will be examined). There is also no evidence of dysplasia.

Conclusion

These biopsies exhibit features of  moderately active chronic inflammatory bowel disease. While the degree of crypt architectural distortion seen within the rectal biopsies is more suggestive of ulcerative colitis the overall preservation of goblet cells and the relative lack of lamina propria inflammation would be unusual for this diagnosis therefore Crohn's disease should also be considered and I note that this was the favoured endoscopic diagnosis.

rectum.  The changes are relatively minor but ulcerative colitis is favoured over Crohn's disease.  The pattern of inflammation within the descending colon of the current colonoscopic series is certainly more ulcerative colitis-like and 
there are no granulomata.  The sparing of the sigmoid and rectum could be explained by medical therapy but correlation with the full clinical history and relevant medical therapy is required.  There is no dysplasia.

All of the biopsies from the right colon are abnormal, there is a moderate
slightly variable increase in chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria
associated with foci of cryptitis and crypt abscess formation. There is focal
goblet cell depletion and mild crypt architectural distortion. Poorly formed
granulomata are seen within the lamina propria not all of which are related to
disrupted crypts.

The biopsies from the transverse colon contain scattered crypt abscesses and
foci of cryptitis associated with a mild focal increase in chronic inflammatory
cells in the lamina propria. There is mild goblet cell depletion but no
significant crypt architectural distortion. Isolated granulomata are not seen.

 1.  Examination showed superficial pieces of large bowel mucosa.  It is difficult to ascertain whether this is from the terminal ileum or colon due to a  complete loss of the villous architecture.  The pieces showed acute and chronic inflammation with ulcer slough, focal cryptitis and distortion.  Occasional giant cells are seen in the base of the ulcer slough/granulation tissue but no definite well formed granuloma are identified.
                                
 2-4.  Examination shows large bowel mucosa that is within normal limits.
                                
 5: Examination shows almost normal large bowel mucosa. There is a suggestion in the middle level of some focal pericryptal inflammation and macrophage  aggregation, however these fall well short of a granuoma.
6. Examination shows a large tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia.  Excision cannot be assessed.
                                
The features of this biopsy series are those of an active inflammation with some patchy inflammation, ulceration and occasional giant cells. If these are from  the terminal ileum,    architecture, suggesting a degree of chronicity, thereby supporting the  possibility of Crohn's disease. If they are from the valve or caecum, as
favoured morphologically, then the architecture is more normal, and this would
be regarded as non-specific ulceration and inflammation. There is an incidental
  sigmoid polyp and minimal non-specific changes in the descending colon.

All of the biopsies are abnormal, although there is relative rectal sparing.  
They show colonic mucosa with a disturbed mucosal architecture with some loss of  crypts, and branching or fusion of crypts.  In some of the fragments there  appears to be reduplication of muscularis mucosae.  There is evidence of Paneth cell metaplasia and a basal plasmacytosis.  There is a relatively diffuse but somewhat variable increase in inflammation in the lamina propria with both acute and chronic inflammation being present.  There is also evidence of cryptitis and crypt abscess formation.  In many of the fragments there is a slightly granulomatous appearance to the inflammation but in many of these fragments this appears centred round damaged crypts and may be cryptolytic in nature.
                                
No CMV inclusions are seen.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
                                
Comment.  This colonoscopic series shows a evidence of mild to moderately active inflammatory bowel disease affecting the entire colon.  Whilst the changes are likely to have been modified by treatment, the relatively diffuse nature of the   inflammation and architectural distortion perhaps favours ulcerative colitis.

The superficial terminal ileal biopsy has normal villous and crypt architecture
with no active inflammation.

There is evidence of active chronic inflammation in all the biopsied colonic
areas, most active in the caecal and asecending colon biopsies.  Inflammation is
relatively diffuse in pattern in the affected mucosa, predominantly comprised of
mixed infiltrate filling the lamina propria, along with more focal cryptitis and
crypt abscess formaiton.  Epithelioid granulomas are seen in the caecum and
descending colon - some are deep within the lamina propria, and not obviously
cryptolytic in nature.  There is mild architectural distortion throughout all
the sampled colonic areas.

The rectal biopsies have essentially normal crypt architecture, with no active
inflammation.

There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

Summary
The findings are of a chronic active pancolitis in keeping with the established inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis.  The disease activity is interpreted as mild, with activity worst in the right colon, and sparing both the terminal ileum and rectum.  Previous pathological descriptions and discourse is noted, the histological findings in this biopsy series may favour Crohn's disease.

A. ILEAL BIOPSIES:
Received five fragments of tissue the largest 4mm in size.

B. RIGHT COLONIC BIOPSIES:
Received four fragments of tissue the largest 4mm in size.

C. TRANSVERSE COLONIC BIOPSIES:
Received four fragments of tissue the largest 3mm in size.

D. LEFT COLONIC BIOPSIES:
Received five fragments of tissue the largest 3mm in size.

E. RECTAL BIOPSIES:
Received four fragments of tissue the largest 4mm in size.

MICRO:
A. Microscopy shows normal small intestinal mucosa.

B. The right sided colonic biopsies show focal mild crypt distortion
and focal crypt dropout. There is a mild inflammatory cell
infiltrate within the lamina propria. There is very focal cryptitis
and focal crypt abscess formation.

C and D. The transverse and left sided colonic biopsies show focal
mild crypt distortion. There is Paneth cell metaplasia in the left
sided biopsies. There is a mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate
throughout.

In the transverse colonic biopsies an occasional single neutrophil
infiltrates crypt epithelium.

In the left sided colonic biopsies there is focal cryptitis with an
occasional crypt abscess. An illdefined microgranuloma is seen in
the lamina propria in part D level 2.

E. In the rectal biopsies there is relatively preserved crypt
architecture. Superficial microgranulomata are seen in the
lamina propria. There is minimal cryptitis. The chronic
inflammatory cell infiltrate is not significantly increased.

SUMMARY:
There is mild chronic inflammation in the colonic biopsies. There is
crypt distortion and Paneth cell metaplasia which are features of
chronicity. There is very focal crypt activity (minimal crypt
activity).

Provided an infective association has been previously excluded the
histological findings would be consistent with chronic Inflammatory
bowel disease.

It was not known at the time of reporting whether this patient was
on immunosuppresant medication. On the request form the description
provided was indeterminate colitis (mildly active, segmental
colitis) however in the biopsies there is inflammation in the right
sided,transverse and left sided biopsies.

However if this was segmental clinically given the microgranulomata
in particular in rectal biopsies I would favour Crohn's disease over
Ulcerative colitis.",2021-10-08,22
