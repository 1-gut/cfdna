The biopsies from all sites in the large bowel are inflamed. There is expansion of the lamina propria by moderate chronic inflammation which appears diffuse in the right side of the colon but more patchy in the left side, particularly in the rectum.

There is patchy mild active inflammation throughout the large bowel, with foci of cryptitis, occasional crypt abscess and neutrophils in the surface of the ileum. There is no frank ulceration or surface erosion. No granulomas or viral inclusions are seen.

Crypt architecture is largely preserved with only occasional minor crypt abnormalities and occasional crypt loss. There is mild mucin depletion throughout. Paneth cell metaplasia is noted in the sigmoid colon and rectum. There is no dysplasia or malignancy.
      
Comment:
The appearances are in keeping with pan colonic, mildly active chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
The histological appearances are rather non-specific, however the patchy nature of the inflammation, particularly distally, would be in keeping with the clinical impression of medically treated Crohn's disease.

The biopsies from the descending colon through to the rectum are all abnormal exhibiting a moderate relatively diffuse increase in chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria associated with quite marked crypt architectural distortion but only mild focal goblet cell depletion and minimal focal cryptitis. These changes are possibly more marked in the biopsies from the descending colon however the more distal biopsies are somewhat superficial so this may represent a sampling error. Paneth cell metaplasia is seen extending to the descending colon. Granulomata are not seen in these biopsies despite examining multiple levels and there is no evidence of dysplasia in any of these biopsies.
                                
Review of previous biopsies:                              
The biopsies from 2009 exhibit the features of a mildly active chronic inflammatory bowel disease involving the left colon and rectum there is moderate crypt architectural distortion with villiform change on the surface. The biopsies from the 2011 exhibit similar features again there is only focal activity in the form of crypt abscesses is a slightly more than the biopsies from 2009. The biopsies from 2012 are the first full colonoscopic series, the terminal ileal biopsies are normal, the colonic biopsies are all abnormal with crypt architectural distortion being the predominant abnormality comment the degree of inflammation and architectural distortion increases distally, ulceration seen within the sigmoid colon and rectum. The sigmoidoscopic biopsies from 2016 extend from this the transverse colon to the rectum and again show evidence of active chronic IBD with focal ulceration. The full colonoscopic series from 2016 also shows increasing crypt architectural distortion distally, the disease is less active in these biopsies and while a small granulomata is seen in one of the biopsies from the ascending colon this appears to be related to an inflamed crypt. Isolated granulomata are not seen in any of these biopsies.
                                
Final conclusion:
All of the biopsies from 2009 to the current biopsies exhibit the features of mildly active chronic inflammatory bowel disease and the pattern is unequivocally that of ulcerative colitis. While in many of the biopsies including the current ones the inflammation is limited to the left colon there are architectural changes seen in the right colon indicating that there has been previous inflammation and indeed right colonic inflammation was seen in the biopsies from 2012. I presume the relative lack of active inflammation the current biopsies is a consequence of  medical therapy.

The biopsies from the neoterminal ileum are of small bowel type mucosa which shows some mild disturbance of the mucosal architecture with quite broad villae and some oedema in the lamina propria.  There is no evidence of active inflammation, however, and granulomas are not seen.

The biopsies from the anastomosis consist of a mixture of probable small bowel type mucosa and colonic mucosa.  One fragment appears uninflamed whilst the other fragment shows rather patchy acute and chronic inflammation with neutrophils present within epithelium, cryptitis but no crypt abscesses.  No granulomas are seen.  No CMV inclusions are seen.

The colonic biopsies are all of normal colonic mucosa showing no evidence of inflammation or granulomas.  There is no evidence of dysplasia.

Comment
This colonoscopic series shows active inflammation at the anastomosis only with some minimal architectural change in the neoterminal ileum.  The inflammation at the anastomosis may not necessarily represent active Crohn's disease, but simply reflect inflammation secondary to the anastomosis.

associated lymphoid tissue.

All of the colonic and rectal biopsies are abnormal.  These show a moderate and
largely diffuse increase in lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the
superficial two-thirds of the lamina propria.  Basal plasmacytosis is noted but
is not a prominent feature.  There is focal cryptitis, most prominent in the
left colon fragments where occasional small crypt abscesses are also noted.  The
crypt architecture is essentially normal.  A few small ill-defined granulomatous
foci are seen within the lamina propria of the left colon fragments.  These
biopsies also show Paneth cell metaplasia.  The subepithelial collagen band is
of normal thickness and there is no excess of intraepithelial lymphocytes.

Comment:  Assuming that an infective aetiology has been excluded, the changes
seen in the colonic and rectal biopsies are suggestive of mildly active Crohn's
disease.  Correlation with faecal calprotectin and small bowel imaging is
suggested.  The features are not typical of microscopic colitis.  There is no
evidence of dysplasia.

All of these biopsies are abnormal exhibiting focal crypt architectural distortion which is more marked in the rectum where it results in a villiform mucosal surface. There are scattered large crypt abscesses and occasional foci of cryptitis. Overall goblet cells are however well preserved. There is an accompanying mild somewhat variable increase in chronic inflammatory cells in lamina propria which is slightly more marked in the rectum.

Granulomata are not seen nor amoebae identified (though further levels will be examined). There is also no evidence of dysplasia.

Conclusion

These biopsies exhibit features of  moderately active chronic inflammatory bowel disease. While the degree of crypt architectural distortion seen within the rectal biopsies is more suggestive of ulcerative colitis the overall preservation of goblet cells and the relative lack of lamina propria inflammation would be unusual for this diagnosis therefore Crohn's disease should also be considered and I note that this was the favoured endoscopic diagnosis.

The histology from the index biopsies from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have been reviewed (UB67047/21).  The index biopsies did demonstrate features of  mildly active distal inflammatory bowel disease involving the sigmoid and 
rectum.  The changes are relatively minor but ulcerative colitis is favoured over Crohn's disease.  The pattern of inflammation within the descending colon of the current colonoscopic series is certainly more ulcerative colitis-like and 
there are no granulomata.  The sparing of the sigmoid and rectum could be explained by medical therapy but correlation with the full clinical history and relevant medical therapy is required.  There is no dysplasia.

relatively diffuse in pattern in the affected mucosa, predominantly comprised of
mixed infiltrate filling the lamina propria, along with more focal cryptitis and

Summary
The findings are of a chronic active pancolitis in keeping with the established inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis.  The disease activity is interpreted as mild, with activity worst in the right colon, and sparing both the terminal ileum and rectum.  Previous pathological descriptions and discourse is noted, the histological findings in this biopsy series may favour Crohn's disease.

"91-12","timepoint_2","Recent diagnosis of IBD-U with pericryptal granulomas, mild ileitis and rectal sparing. Good response to 5ASA and now in remission with BOx1/day and no systemic upset.

Well tolerated with water insertion. Good views to TI. Mild (Mayo=1) colitis in sigmoid colon with erythema and some loss of vascular pattern. Otherwise normal to TI.

Biopsy series taken.

Suggest: Will write with histology. Continue current Rx. FU as planned with Dr Nowell.","MACRO:
A. ILEAL BIOPSIES:
Received five fragments of tissue the largest 4mm in size.

B. RIGHT COLONIC BIOPSIES:
Received four fragments of tissue the largest 4mm in size.

C. TRANSVERSE COLONIC BIOPSIES:
Received four fragments of tissue the largest 3mm in size.

D. LEFT COLONIC BIOPSIES:
Received five fragments of tissue the largest 3mm in size.

E. RECTAL BIOPSIES:
Received four fragments of tissue the largest 4mm in size.

MICRO:
A. Microscopy shows normal small intestinal mucosa.

B. The right sided colonic biopsies show focal mild crypt distortion
and focal crypt dropout. There is a mild inflammatory cell
infiltrate within the lamina propria. There is very focal cryptitis
and focal crypt abscess formation.

C and D. The transverse and left sided colonic biopsies show focal
mild crypt distortion. There is Paneth cell metaplasia in the left
sided biopsies. There is a mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate
throughout.

In the transverse colonic biopsies an occasional single neutrophil
infiltrates crypt epithelium.

In the left sided colonic biopsies there is focal cryptitis with an
occasional crypt abscess. An illdefined microgranuloma is seen in
the lamina propria in part D level 2.

E. In the rectal biopsies there is relatively preserved crypt
architecture. Superficial microgranulomata are seen in the
lamina propria. There is minimal cryptitis. The chronic
inflammatory cell infiltrate is not significantly increased.

SUMMARY:
There is mild chronic inflammation in the colonic biopsies. There is
crypt distortion and Paneth cell metaplasia which are features of
chronicity. There is very focal crypt activity (minimal crypt
activity).

Provided an infective association has been previously excluded the
histological findings would be consistent with chronic Inflammatory
bowel disease.

It was not known at the time of reporting whether this patient was
on immunosuppresant medication. On the request form the description
provided was indeterminate colitis (mildly active, segmental
colitis) however in the biopsies there is inflammation in the right
sided,transverse and left sided biopsies.

However if this was segmental clinically given the microgranulomata
in particular in rectal biopsies I would favour Crohn's disease over
Ulcerative colitis.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA

"91-17","timepoint_2","Bowel preparation with 2 picolax was poor. A digital rectal examination was performed.
The colonoscope was inserted via the anus to the neo-terminal ileum. The caecum was identified by ileal intubation. The rest of the examination to the limit of insertion was normal. The patient has a resected colon as a result of a right hemicolectomy. There were no peri-operative complications. 

 Site a: An area wholly within the neo-terminal ileum
Specimens: 4x random biopsy.
Site b: Neo-terminal ileum
Specimens: 4x biopsy.

 Diagnoses
  Ileitis.

 Advice/Comments
  Scope to neo terminal ileum. Anastomosis widely patent - some peristomal inflammation and ulceration. Difficult to find entrance in to ileum but once located scope could be advanced relative;y easily and on the whole the mucosa looked healthy with only one or 2 visible ulcers (size approx. 0.5cm).

"91-21","timepoint_1","There was patchy segmental inflammation predominantly in the rectum, sigmoid and caecum.
Strictured area in mid-sigmoid with evidence of active inflammation and linear ulcers, although the scope passed through without difficulty.
Less inflamed stricture at the caecum with marked narrowing just adjacent to the ileo-caecal valve. 

Biopsies taken of two strictured areas in separate pots as well as colonic biopsy series. 

Discussed importance of medicine compliance (admits not taking azathioprine regularly though sure he hasn't missed any adalimumab injections).
Will discuss with Dr Seenan, may require escalation of therapy.",NA,NA,NA,NA,13,NA
"91-22","timepoint_1","Diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Smoker. No FHx IBD but FC=244.

Reasonable preparation and good views with washing and position chnage.

Patchy inflammation with small aphthae to caecum where this was more pronounced. TI normal but appearances suggestive of Crohn's colitis.

Suggest: Prednisolone 40mg daily reducing by 5mg per week to stop alongside bone protection (e.g. Accrete D3). Will arrange FU. Suitable for MUSIC +/- BIOPIC so PIS given for MUSIC and seems happy to consider. IBD Helpline details provided.",NA,NA,NA,NA,13,13
